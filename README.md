# Scott's Simple Weather API

## Build a simple Express API to serve up weather info. for one location.

This project uses OpenWeatherAPI's Once Call API's free tier. You need to sign up for an API key, and then your weather server checks for new weather info every 5 mins. The data is cached so you don't exceed the One Call API's free tier limit of 1,000 requests per day.
